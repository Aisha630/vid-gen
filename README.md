# Video Generation
This repository is part of a research project for CS 6303 Topics in LLM, focused on reducing web traffic by enabling video generation on end devices. By generating videos locally on end-user devices through generative models, this project aims to address these issues, reducing data transmission requirements while maintaining video quality.
